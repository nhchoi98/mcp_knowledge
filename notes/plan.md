## Plan

- [ ] Inventory existing markdown files and decide new category mapping with canonical slugs.
- [ ] Create target directory structure (frontend, backend, cs-basics, process, tools, glossary) and add category README TOCs.
- [ ] Add normalized frontmatter to all markdown files with required fields.
- [ ] Merge duplicate topics (browser/Web platform, rendering layers, state management, MSW) and map old paths to new canonical files.
- [ ] Move/rename files to new structure, update internal links, and generate mapping table.
- [ ] Add markdownlint/Prettier config and link check script; update root README with navigation and principles.
- [ ] Run applicable checks (if any), gather code review + CodeQL feedback, and finalize summary.
